## Introduction
Argania trees play a crucial role in the ecological and socio-economic landscape of the Souss region. This research aims to assess their precise distribution and abundance, addressing challenges like over-harvesting, habitat destruction, and climate change impacts.

## Materials and Methods
The study focuses on the Admine forest in the Souss region, southwest Morocco. Using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we manually identified and geolocated Argania trees. Our approach combined manual data collection with pixel-precise datasets to enhance machine learning models' accuracy for tree detection.

## Results and Discussion
Our comprehensive dataset reflects the spatial distribution and ecological significance of Argania trees in the region. We conducted temporal analyses to examine seasonal trends and environmental impacts. The findings provide valuable insights for monitoring deforestation, guiding conservation strategies, and supporting evidence-based policy and decision-making.

## Conclusion

This study represents a significant effort in mapping Argania trees' distribution, offering a vital tool for monitoring tree loss and identifying deforestation hotspots. The implications of this research are crucial for sustainable resource utilization and environmental impact assessment.
